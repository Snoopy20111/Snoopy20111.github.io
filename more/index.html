				<p class="remove-top-margin-text">Kerbal Space Program Mod.<br>Praise the Sun!<br><br>This was a project I originally undertook during my senior year of high school as a directed study. I modeled, textured, animated, and scripted two new experiment parts, based upon those aboard NASA's real SOHO and STEREO missions. Over the years I made small additions, such as experiment requirements, custom sfx, and loading real-time images from NASA's feeds when the experiment is run. As KSP is made in Unity, I used it and C# extensively.</p>

				<p class="remove-top-margin-text">This project was a re-interpretation of Van Gogh's famous Sunflower series of paintings.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Musically, each painting was assigned a key on the circle of 5ths, based on their respective "darkness" of scale/color.</li>
					<li>Each key had a handful of guitar passages assigned, which were improvised based on the codes of the most common hex colors, backed with a soft synth pad for atmosphere.</li>
					<li>The chances of each passage playing corresponded to their color's frequency in the painting. Every so often the key and underlying painting would change as well.</li>
					<li>Visually, each of the paintings would be reduced to the most common colors stretched to the window's size, and when a crummy beat detector found a "beat," it would create or destroy <a class="decorated-links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">voronoi shapes,</a> sampling the colors beneath.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>The piece was intended to be projected and left running in a gallery, with the goal to create something new while maintaining a sense of the creative act in the first place: that is, structured and informed improvisation, where the little details are lost to time.</p>
